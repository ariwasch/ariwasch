### Hi, my name is Ari
#### About me
I'm a third-year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have a broad range of interests, from robotics to app development and from software to hardware.

#### ðŸ”­ Cool things that I have worked on
- [Rambl](https://rambl.app), public chat room where users can talk to everyone within a certain radius or on a certain topic
- [HandsFree](https://devpost.com/software/hands-free), program to control a computer using only facial cues
- [Bluetooth Digital Keypad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluetooth-digital-keypad/id1501984264), app to control electronics projects through bluetooth, like my [3D-printed tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGPXaiinZnM) and [LED speaker hat](https://youtu.be/IyR05Nh5o94)
